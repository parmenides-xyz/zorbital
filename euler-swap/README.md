# EulerSwap

EulerSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) that integrates with Euler [credit vaults](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-vault-kit-white-paper/) to provide deeper liquidity for swaps. When a user initiates a swap, a smart contract called an EulerSwap operator borrows the required output token using the input token as collateral. This model enables up to 40x the liquidity depth of traditional AMMs by making idle assets in Euler more efficient. Unlike traditional AMMs, which often fragment liquidity across multiple pools, EulerSwap further increases capital efficiency by allowing a single, cross-collateralised credit vault to support multiple asset pairs at once. At its core, EulerSwap uses a flexible AMM curve to optimise swap pricing, ensuring deep liquidity while maintaining market balance. By combining just-in-time liquidity, shared liquidity across pools, and customisable AMM mechanics, EulerSwap reduces inefficiencies in liquidity provision, offering deeper markets, lower costs, and greater control for liquidity providers.

## Getting Started

The `script` folder contains scripts for deploying pools, as well as executing test trades on them. See the dedicated [README](./script/README.md)

## For Solvers

### Swaps

There are two ways to swap directly on EulerSwap: via a Uniswap V4 hook or by calling the pool’s [swap](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-swap/blob/1f73f5cb07f2e64e8c9815076749574b1b54e204/src/interfaces/IEulerSwap.sol#L65) function, which has the same ABI and behaviour as Uniswap V2 pools.

Additionally, the `EulerSwapPeriphery` contract provides helper functions: [swapExactIn](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-swap/blob/1f73f5cb07f2e64e8c9815076749574b1b54e204/src/interfaces/IEulerSwapPeriphery.sol#L8) and [swapExactOut](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-swap/blob/1f73f5cb07f2e64e8c9815076749574b1b54e204/src/interfaces/IEulerSwapPeriphery.sol#L21)

### Quotes

EulerSwap pools expose the [computeQuote](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-swap/blob/1f73f5cb07f2e64e8c9815076749574b1b54e204/src/interfaces/IEulerSwap.sol#L53) function for quoting both exact input and exact output trades. The function will revert if there is insufficient liquidity for the requested amount or if the pool has been decommissioned. If the function returns a quote, it means the trade should be executable based on the pool’s current state, but it's not guaranteed if the pool is abandoned or not maintained properly (See the **Creating and Decommissioning Pools** section).

The `EulerSwapPeriphery` contract also provides the [quoteExactInput](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-swap/blob/1f73f5cb07f2e64e8c9815076749574b1b54e204/src/interfaces/IEulerSwapPeriphery.sol#L32) and [quoteExactOutput](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-swap/blob/1f73f5cb07f2e64e8c9815076749574b1b54e204/src/interfaces/IEulerSwapPeriphery.sol#L38) helper functions

### Liquidity

Unlike traditional AMMs, EulerSwap pools do not hold token reserves directly. Instead, liquidity is provided just-in-time from the underlying Euler lending vaults. The amount that can be deposited to or withdrawn from the lending vaults depends on the current state of the EulerSwap account and various factors, such as supply and borrow caps, vault utilization, etc. This means there may be limits at any given moment on how much can be sold or bought in a trade.

These limits are directional, resulting in four distinct parameters: input and output limits for trades in each direction. The [getLimits](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-swap/blob/1f73f5cb07f2e64e8c9815076749574b1b54e204/src/interfaces/IEulerSwap.sol#L59) function can be used to fetch the current liquidity limits available for swapping and is also available via `EulerSwapPeriphery`.

Note that these limits are enforced by the quoting functions, which will revert if a trade exceeds them.

### Creating and Decomissioning Pools

EulerSwap pools are created by the `EulerSwapFactory` contract, which emits a `PoolDeployed` event and provides functions to list existing instances.

Afterwards, pools can optionally be registered in the `EulerSwapRegistry` contract, which advertises them as ready for swapping. Doing so may require the posting of a small validity bond.

Note that EulerSwap instances are installed on top of regular accounts within the Euler lending platform. This means an LP can abandon an EulerSwap instance simply by withdrawing their position from the lending vaults. In such cases, the registry has no indication that the pool is no longer operational, but quoting functions or swap simulations will start reverting. If a pool is misconfigured and unable to fulfil swaps it is claiming via its `getLimits()` function, the bond may be forfeit and the misconfigured pool removed from the registry.

When a pool is decomissioned, it is recommended to remove from the registry in order to recover the validity bond.
